## NULL values :boat:
**Our next lesson will review how to filter data that includes NULL values.**

## Missing values :rowboat:
- When we were learning how to use the COUNT keyword, we learned that we could include or exclude non-missing values depending on whether or not we use the asterisk in our query.
- But what is a missing or non-missing value? In SQL, NULL represents a missing or unknown value.
- Why is this useful? In the real world, our databases will likely have empty fields either because of human error or because the information is not available or is unknown.
- Knowing how to handle these fields is essential as they can affect any analyses we do.

## null :bike:
- For example, we used COUNT all with an asterisk on the left.
- Suppose our goal is to analyze posthumous success using data from the people table.
- We might make the wrong assumption that because we have a field name called deathdate, this information is available for everyone.
- Half of them are, in fact, NULL, as we can see on the right, so we would make an inaccurate judgment on what the data means.
  
```js
// Select the title of every film that doesn't have a budget associated with it and use the alias no_budget_info.
SELECT title AS no_budget_info
FROM films
WHERE budget IS NULL;

// Count the number of films with a language associated with them and use the alias count_language_known.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_language_known
FROM films
WHERE language IS NOT NULL;
```

## IS NULL :oncoming_automobile:
- One quick way to see how much of our data is missing is by using IS NULL with the WHERE clause.
- Here is an example where we have checked to see which names do not have a recorded birthdate in our table.

## IS NOT NULL :car:
- On the left is an example of counting the missing birthdates in the people table.
- The count is 2245. Sometimes, we'll want to filter out missing values, so we only get results that are not NULL.
- To do this, we can use the IS NOT NULL operator.
- For example, this query on the right gives the count of all people whose birth dates are not missing in the people table, giving us a new count of 6152.

## COUNT() vs IS NOT NULL :truck:
- There may be a question about the difference between using COUNT with a field name and using the same COUNT with the added WHERE clause with IS NOT NULL.
- The answer is there is no difference, as both will be counting non-missing values.

## NULL put simply :station:
- Before we wrap up this lesson, let's review what we've learned.
- NULL values are missing values, and they are very common in the real world.
- It is good practice to know how many NULL values are in our data by using the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL operator for filtering.
- These keywords will help to identify, select, or exclude missing values. Don't worry; this will soon become second nature because it is that common!
