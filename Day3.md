## Data :ocean:
**Welcome to the final part of the databases chapter! This lesson will focus on the data inside a database as well as its storage.**

## SQL data types :mushroom:
When a table is created, a data type must be indicated for each field.<br/>
The data type is chosen based on the type of data that the field will hold - a number, text, or a date for example.<br/>
We use data types for several reasons.<br/>
1. Different types of data are stored differently and take up different amounts of storage space.
2. Some operations only apply to certain data types.
> It makes sense to multiply a number by another number, but it does not make sense to multiply text by other text for example.
