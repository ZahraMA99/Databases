## Course goals :dart:

1. we will get to know databases, which store and organize data electronically.
2.  We'll discuss how databases and the data they store are structured.
3.  to extract data from databases using SQL code in Chapter Two.

## Introducing databases :performing_arts:
A database stores data. Let's imagine that we are in charge of storing and organizing data for a library.
We might set up a database that holds information such as the data pictured here on patrons, books, and checkouts.
This information is housed in objects called tables, with data organized into rows and columns.
This database contains a patrons table, a books table, and a checkouts table.
