## Course goals :dart:

1. we will get to know databases, which store and organize data electronically.
2.  We'll discuss how databases and the data they store are structured.
3.  to extract data from databases using SQL code in Chapter Two.

## Introducing databases :performing_arts:
A database stores data. Let's imagine that we are in charge of storing and organizing data for a library.<br/>
We might set up a database that holds information such as the data pictured here on patrons, books, and checkouts.<br/>
This information is housed in objects called tables, with data organized into rows and columns.<br/>
This database contains a patrons table, a books table, and a checkouts table.<br/>

## Relational databases :performing_arts:
A relational database defines relationships between tables of data inside the database.

## Database advantages :triangular_flag_on_post:

1. Databases can store much more data, and storage is more secure due to encryption.
2. Many users can write queries to gather insights from the data at the same time.

> When a database is queried, the data stored inside the database does not change: rather, the database information is accessed and presented according to instructions in the query.

## SQL
SQL! SQL, or S-Q-L, is short for Structured Query Language. It is the most widely used programming language for creating, querying, and updating relational databases.
