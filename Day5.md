## Writing queries :tulip:
It's time to level up on our SQL queries by learning a few more commonly used keywords. Let's dive in.

## Aliasing :maple_leaf:
- Sometimes it can be helpful to rename columns in our result set, whether for clarity or brevity.
- We can do this using aliasing. Perhaps we'd like to select the name and hire year for each record in the employees table.
- We could alias the name column as first_name in the query by adding the AS keyword to indicate an alias of first_name after selecting the name field.
- The result set now has first_name rather than name as the column header.
- The alias only applies to the result of this particular query; in other words, the field name in the employees table itself is still name rather than first_name.

## Selecting distinct records :earth_africa:
- Some SQL questions require a way to return a list of unique values.
- Let's imagine that we are interested in getting a list of years in which we hired our current employees.
- If we select the year_hired field from the employees table, the result set shows several years listed twice, which isn't what we are looking for.
- To get a list of years with no repeat values, we can add the DISTINCT keyword before the year_hired field name in the SELECT statement.
- Now, we can see that all of our employees were hired in just four different years.

## DISTINCT with multiple fields :partly_sunny:
- It's possible to return the unique combinations of multiple field values by listing multiple fields after the DISTINCT keyword.
- Take a look at the employees table. Perhaps we'd like to know the years that different departments hired employees.
- We could use this SQL query to look at this information, selecting the dept_id and year_hired from the employees table.
- Looking at the results, we see that department three hired two employees in 2021.

## DISTINCT with multiple fields :milky_way:
- To avoid repeating this information, we could add the DISTINCT keyword before the fields to select.
- Notice that the department id and year_hired fields still have repeat values individually,
- but none of the records are the same: they are all unique combinations of the two fields.

## Views :phone:
- Finally, let's discuss saving SQL result sets. In SQL, a view refers to a table that is the result of a saved SQL SELECT statement.
- Views are considered virtual tables, which means that the data a view contains is not generally stored in the database.
- Rather, it is the query code that is stored for future use.
- A benefit of this is that whenever the view is accessed, it automatically updates the query results to account for any updates to the underlying database.
- To create a view, we'll add a line of code before the SELECT statement: CREATE VIEW, then the name we'd like for the new view, then the AS keyword to assign the results of the query to the new view name.
- Here, we create a view called employee_hire_years by assigning the results of a query selecting three fields from the employees table to a new view.
- There is no result set when creating a view.

## Using views :pager:
- Once a view is created, however, we can query it just as we would a normal table by selecting FROM the view.
