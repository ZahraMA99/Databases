##  Tables :rainbow:
Main building block of databases: tables!

## A seat at the table :boat:
We saw in the previous lesson that databases are organized into tables, which hold related data about a particular subject.<br/>
tables are organized into rows and columns<br/>
**rows are often referred to as records and columns as fields.**

> A table's fields are limited to those set when the database was created, but the number of rows is unlimited.

## Good table manners :carousel_horse:
*Let's talk a little bit about table naming.* <br/>
**Table names should be lowercase and should not include spaces**
> we use underscores in place of spaces. And ideally, a table name would refer to a collective group (like "inventory")<br/> but it's also okay for the table to have a plural name (such as "products").
