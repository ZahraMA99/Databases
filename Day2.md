##  Tables :rainbow:
Main building block of databases: tables!

## A seat at the table
We saw in the previous lesson that databases are organized into tables, which hold related data about a particular subject.<br/>
tables are organized into rows and columns<br/>
**rows are often referred to as records and columns as fields.**

> A table's fields are limited to those set when the database was created, but the number of rows is unlimited.
